Option 1A: You stay still and quiet, hoping the animal will leave. After a few tense moments, the rustling stops, and you hear nothing but the sound of your own breathing. Do you:

B2. Try to get some sleep now that the animal is gone.
B3. Build a bigger, sturdier shelter to protect yourself from future animal encounters.

A2. Stay hidden and observe the village from a distance.

B1. Continue climbing trees to get a better view.
B2. Stay put and try to find some food and water nearby.
